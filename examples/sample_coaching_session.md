# Sample Coaching Session Transcript

A mentoring session between Kevin (coach) and Alex (mentee) about interview preparation and communication skills.

---

**Kevin:** Hey Alex, good to see you again. How's the interview prep going?

**Alex:** Hey Kevin! Thanks for making time. I'm struggling a bit with my system design interviews. I keep getting feedback that I'm not communicating clearly enough.

**Kevin:** Got it. That's a really common issue. Let me give you some advice on this - communication in system design is actually more important than the design itself.

**Alex:** Really? How so?

**Kevin:** Think about it - the interviewer can't read your mind. If you have a brilliant design but can't articulate it, they'll never know. Here's what I'd recommend: always think out loud. Narrate your thought process.

**Alex:** That makes sense. But sometimes I feel like I'm rambling.

**Kevin:** Great observation. There's a difference between thinking out loud and rambling. Here's a framework I use - I call it the "3-minute check-in":

Every 3 minutes, pause and say something like: "Let me check in - I've been talking about [X]. Does this direction make sense, or would you like me to explore something else?"

**Alex:** Oh that's actually really helpful. So it's like built-in course corrections.

**Kevin:** Exactly! Here's another tip - when you propose a design decision, always follow the "what, why, tradeoff" pattern. For example, don't just say "I'll use Redis for caching." Instead say:

"I'm choosing Redis for the cache layer because it offers sub-millisecond latency and supports expiration policies. The tradeoff is it's an additional system to manage, but for this use case, the performance benefit outweighs the operational overhead."

**Alex:** I see. So I should always articulate the reasoning.

**Kevin:** Yes! And here's something important - you should try practicing this in front of a mirror or recording yourself. I know it sounds awkward, but it really helps.

**Alex:** That does sound awkward. But I'll try it.

**Kevin:** Trust me, it works. Now, what about handling pushback? Have you gotten any feedback on that?

**Alex:** Actually yes. In my last mock, the interviewer challenged my database choice and I kind of froze.

**Kevin:** That's completely normal. Pushback is actually a good sign - it means they're engaged. Here's my recommendation for handling challenges:

First, acknowledge the concern: "That's a great point."
Then, either defend with data: "I considered that, and here's why I still chose X..."
Or pivot gracefully: "You're right, let me reconsider. Given that constraint, maybe Y would be better."

**Alex:** So I don't have to stick with my original choice?

**Kevin:** Absolutely not! In fact, being able to pivot shows intellectual flexibility. That's a Staff+ signal. What you should avoid is getting defensive or just saying "I don't know" and shutting down.

**Alex:** Got it. Any other tips for the behavioral portions?

**Kevin:** For behavioral, the most important thing is using STAR format but making it feel natural. Don't be robotic about it. Let me coach you through an example. Give me a situation you'd use for "tell me about a time you dealt with conflict."

**Alex:** Um, okay. So there was this time when my team lead wanted to ship a feature that I thought had security issues...

**Kevin:** Perfect topic. Now, here's what you should try - structure your answer like this:

"This happened when [brief context]. The conflict was [what exactly]. I decided to [your approach] because [reasoning]. The result was [outcome] and I learned [lesson]."

Notice it hits all the STAR points but flows naturally.

**Alex:** That's really helpful. I tend to ramble in behavioral questions too.

**Kevin:** Your homework for next time: write out 5 behavioral stories using that structure. Don't memorize them word for word, but internalize the structure so it comes naturally.

**Alex:** Okay, I'll do that. Should I practice them with anyone?

**Kevin:** Yes! Actually, here's an idea - record yourself answering behavioral questions and watch them back. Look for filler words like "um" and "basically". Those are confidence killers.

**Alex:** Ugh, I know I say "basically" a lot.

**Kevin:** That's great self-awareness. One more thing before we wrap up - we should discuss your timeline. When are your real interviews?

**Alex:** I have a Google onsite in three weeks.

**Kevin:** Okay, so we need to figure out a practice schedule. Let's aim for at least 6 more mock interviews before then. Can you do two per week?

**Alex:** That's aggressive but I'll make it work.

**Kevin:** Good. I'd suggest mixing the types - 2 system design, 2 coding, 2 behavioral. And one more thing - review your notes after each mock, but don't obsess. The goal is improvement, not perfection.

**Alex:** Thanks Kevin, this was really valuable. Same time next week?

**Kevin:** Yes, and come prepared with those 5 behavioral stories written out. We'll practice one together.

**Alex:** Will do. Thanks again!

**Kevin:** Good luck with the prep. You've got this.
